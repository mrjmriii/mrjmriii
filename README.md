## Portfolio snapshot
- American security builder focused on resilient, validation-first systems
- Target roles: Security Engineer, Junior Security Architect, DevSecOps Generalist
- Design intent: scalable from small business to enterprise without changing core control objectives
- Delivery focus: reproducible automation, clear rollback paths, and evidence-backed operations

## Pinned work
- Security Ops Blueprint: https://github.com/mrjmriii/security-ops-blueprint
- Purple Team Certification Lab: https://github.com/mrjmriii/purple-team-certification-lab

## What I build
| Area | Focus | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | Auth, directory services, PKI/TLS | Trust anchors and least-privilege access |
| Segmentation | Zones, routing, exposure control | Safe service boundaries and failover |
| Telemetry | SIEM, case mgmt, intel flow | High-fidelity signals and response loops |
| Validation | Drills, RTO/RPO, evidence | Measurable resilience and auditability |

## Operating model
```text
signal_path = design -> automate -> validate -> evidence
posture     = safety_first, minimal_diffs, reproducible_runs
```

## Portfolio principles
- Documentation is a control surface, not just a reference
- Automation is paired with validation hooks and rollback guidance
- Lab-only offensive postures stay isolated and reversible
